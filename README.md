# Marvel Comic Network Demonstration

This is a simple demonstration of using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) (v4.0) to produce an interactive network graph from a sample dataset. In this case I've used the [Marvel Comics Network](http://bioinfo.uib.es/~joemiro/marvel.html) data from R. Alberich, J.Miro-Julia, and F. Rossello.

The resulting network graph extends [Mike Bostock's simple graph demo](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) with some additional features that could be useful for DH scholars interested in networks. I've included a slider that redraws the network based on edge weights, a dropdown for three different types of node centrality, and the ability to click on nodes to see ego networks.

You can see a working demo of the network at [this bl.ocks.org page](http://bl.ocks.org/jrladd/c76799aa63efd7176bd9006f403e854d).
